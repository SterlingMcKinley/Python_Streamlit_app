#Streamlit Python Application

In this project, I wanted to a quick application or website using Python.  I had no direction what type of application so I allowed my animation to come up with something minor. However, I chose to use a package/module that I was not familair with. After using the package, I found myself impressed. I will surely continue to explore it further.

This application utilized:
 * Python
 * markdown
 * Streamlit module/package
 * Lottie animation
 * json
